# bookify
Bookify is a web application that allows users to discover, browse, and reserve tables at restaurants. It currently features a clean homepage with quick access to sign-up, log-in, and browse options. Each user role Owner, Customer, and Staff has its own dashboard with a ‚Üê Home button for easy navigation. The project uses simple HTML/CSS templates, and clean URL routing where the root path displays the new home.html design.

We are currently in Sprint 1, focusing on setting up the core architecture, authentication system, and basic user dashboards.
In Sprints 2 and 3, we will continue to develop and integrate all MVP features, including real-time queue management, reservation confirmation, restaurant analytics, and an enhanced user interface.

To run Bookify locally:

Create and activate a virtual environment.

Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt or pip install django.

Run migrations: python manage.py migrate.

Start the development server: python manage.py runserver.
Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/
 to explore the app.

Bookify represents the foundation of a complete restaurant booking system emphasizing clear structure, user roles, and an evolving product roadmap.
